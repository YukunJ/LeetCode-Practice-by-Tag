**224. Basic Calculator**

```Tag: Stack/Math```

**Description:**

Given a string ```s``` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as ```eval()```.


**Example1**:

        Input: s = "1 + 1"
        Output: 2

**Example2**:

        Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
        Output: 3
        
**Example3**:

        Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
        Output: 23
        
**Example4**:

        Input: s = "+48 + -48"
        Output: 0
        Explanation:Â Numbers can have multiple digits and start with +/-.

        We use a stack to simulate the calculation process
        since we only have '+' or '-', a sign signal would suffice to store the operator
        when we encounter a '('
            we need to priorize the calculation in the parenthesis,
        so we will store the current result and operator in the stack
        when we later encounter a closing ')' 
            we pop the operator and left-operator out to perform the calculation
