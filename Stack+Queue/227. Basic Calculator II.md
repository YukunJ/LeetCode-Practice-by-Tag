**227. Basic Calculator II**

```Tag: Stack/Math```

**Description:**

Given a string ```s``` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

**Note**: 

+ You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as ```eval()```
+ ```s``` consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
+ ```s``` represents a valid expression.
+ All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 2^31 - 1].

**Example1**:

        Input: s = "3+2*2"
        Output: 7

**Example2**:

        Input: s = " 3/2 "
        Output: 1
        
**Example3**:

        Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
        Output: 5

        In this question, we don't have parenthesis, so we just need to
        evaluate '*' and '/' before '+' and '-'
        We use a Stack to store element processed
        1.  when it's a '+' we store the number
        2.  when it's a '-' we store the negation of the number
        3.  when it's '*/', we pop out previous number from stack and do operation accordingly

        denote n := len(s)
        Time Complexity : O(n)
        Space Complexity : O(n)
