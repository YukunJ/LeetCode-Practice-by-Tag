**18. 4Sum**

```Tag: two pointers/sorting```

**Description:**

Given an array ```nums``` of ```n``` integers, return an array of all the **unique** quadruplets ```[nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]]``` such that:

+ 0 <= ```a, b, c, d``` < ```n```

+ ```a, b, c, and d``` are distinct.

+ ```nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target```

You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example1**:

        Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
        Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]

**Example2**:

        Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], target = 8
        Output: [[2,2,2,2]]

        This question is much similar to question 15 <3 Sum>
        If we use brute force enumeration search, we will need O(n^4) time to complete the task, terrible
        similarly to <3 Sum>, we could first sort on the list making it ascending order
        And we first first and second pointer, making third and fourth a sliding window
            because when fix first and second, we make to have
            nums[third] + nums[fourth] = target - nums[first] - nums[second] in the array area nums[second+1:]
                where first < second < third < fourth 
            and we can keep sliding window with third starting at second+1 and move right-ward,
                        fourth starting at last position and move left-ward, until they meet or conditions met
        plus, we can add some pre-stopping check to save time 
        
        denote n := len(nums)
        Time Complexity : O(n^3)
        Space Complexity : O(1) if in place sort or O(logn) if recursively or O(n) if create auxiliary storage
                           depends on sorting algorithm implementation details
