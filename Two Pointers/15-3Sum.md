**15. 3Sum**

```Tag: two pointers```

**Description:**

Given an integer array ```nums```, return all the triplets ```[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]``` such that ```i != j, i != k, and j != k```, and ```nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0```.

Notice that the solution set must not contain **duplicate** triplets.

**Example1**:

        Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
        Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

**Example2**:

        Input: nums = []
        Output: []
        
**Example3**:

        Input: nums = [0]
        Output: []

        To avoid duplicate, we first take O(nlogn) to sort the array in increasing order
        to make sure that any triplet (a,b,c) satisfies a <= b <= c 
        when first fix the a, since we must have b <= c and b+c = -a,
        we can use two pointers to move both from left to right and right to left
        this can reduce the inner loop from O(n^2) to O(n)
        
        Time Complexity : O(n^2) by outer loop nested with two-pointers sliding
        Space Complexity: O(1) (if we sort the array in place) or O(n) (use extra array for storage in the sorting process)
